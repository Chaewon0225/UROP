# UROP
# Notes on 12/03/23
# 1. The initial background screen is 'bedroom'. This is until Kayla creates a new home screen. It only has one rectangle with the text 'Game Start'. COMPLETED!
# 2. When the user clicks on the 'Game Start' rectangle, the background image switches to 'kitchen' and draws three rectangles: open the fridge, cook, and open the cookbook. COMPLETED!
# 3. When the user clicks on the three rectangles, each rectangle will open different sprite groups.
# The codes to be merged this week include the background switch example (for #1)/making an image pop up (for #3, when the user clicks on 'cook', the 'cooking failed' image can pop up when certain conditions are not met.)
# The codes for moving an image to another place (by drag and drop) are needed for adding the ingredients to the cooking area. For that, we first need a sprite group with all the ingredients. I will work on this part this week.
